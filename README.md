# Filter and Display UFO data using HTML and JavaScript

## Overview
A Data Journalist must sort through a large dataset about UFO sightings. The Jourlanlist would like to display the data on a HTML webpage. The information is in JavaScript, so I was tasked with turning the data into a table and creating filters on each column. I created a JavaScript array that allows end users the ability to filter by date, state, country, shape and city of the UFO sightings. 

## Results

#### Stacking Filters 

The search can be further focused by apploying multiple filters. In the first image the first two filters are applied, and for the following image another filter is applied.

## Conclusion 
All filters require an exact value so if there is a spelling error in the "city" filter and all other filters are correct, the result won’t populate. In addition, the color scheme isn’t visually accessible to all. I’d recommend allowing the option to have a dark interface and a bright interface for more accessibility. In addition, adding the “type of sightings” filter and a key word filter would allow for a more detailed search through the comments.
